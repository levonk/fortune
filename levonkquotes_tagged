A little bird was flying south for the Winter. It was so cold the bird froze
and fell to the ground into a large field.
While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to
realize how warm he was.
The dung was actually thawing him out!
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.
A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following
the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,
and promptly dug him out and ate him.

An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit saw

"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.
"They're packed with nutrients."
The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him
enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.
Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of
the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.

Explain it to a child.  ~8 years old.
When you write out an idea from start to finish in simple
language that a child can understand (tip: use only the

concept at a deeper level and simplify relationships and
connections between ideas.  If you struggle, you have a
clear understanding of where you have some gaps.  That

Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet
people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous,
malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their
ignorance of true good and evil. But I have seen that the nature
of good is what is right, and the nature of evil what is wrong;
and I have reflected that the nature of the offender himself is
akin to my own - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing
in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. Therefore I
cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with
their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him.
We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids,

There’s a saying that any idiot can build a bridge that can
carry a load, but only an engineer can build a bridge that
*barely* carries a load. This is a desirable trait; a bridge
that can carry any load would also carry an astronomical cost.
Designing to a price point that you’ve verified by market
research is engineering, and Juicero is the most spectacular
failure of this type of engineering in recent memory. Of
course, it doesn’t help that Juicero has DRM’ed food, but
the success of K-cups tells me that’s probably not a

When someone is honestly 55 percent right, that’s very good
and there’s no use wrangling. And if someone is 60 percent
right, it’s wonderful, it’s great luck, and let him thank God.
But what’s to be said about 75 percent right? Wise people
say this is suspicious. Well, and what about 100 percent
right? Whoever says he’s 100 percent right is a fanatic,

Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again.
Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are
those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.
At some point, you are bound to stumble. If you’re constantly
pushing yourself higher and higher, the law of averages predicts
that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to
remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just
life trying to move us in another direction. Now, when you’re
down there in the hole, it looks like failure. When that moment
comes, it’s okay to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself
time to mourn what you think you may have lost. But then, here’s
the key: Learn from every mistake, because every experience,
particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you

'Tis true my form is something odd,
But blaming me is blaming God;

Or grasp the ocean with a span,

	  "False Greatness" by Isaac Watts
