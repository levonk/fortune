A little bird was flying south for the Winter. It was so cold the bird froze 
and fell to the ground into a large field.

While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to 
realize how warm he was.

The dung was actually thawing him out!
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following
the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,
and promptly dug him out and ate him.

Morals of the story:

An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit saw
the eagle and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing?"

The eagle answered, "Sure , why not."

All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the
top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."

"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.
"They're packed with nutrients."

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him
enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.

The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.

Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of
the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.

Explain it to a child.  ~8 years old.
When you write out an idea from start to finish in simple

concept at a deeper level and simplify relationships and
connections between ideas.  If you struggle, you have a
clear understanding of where you have some gaps.  That
tension is good -- it heralds an opportunity to learn.

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste
a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous 
amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if
it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless
luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last
by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed
away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not
given a short life but we make it short, and we are not
ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how
to use it.

Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet
people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous,
malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their
ignorance of true good and evil. But I have seen that the nature
of good is what is right, and the nature of evil what is wrong;
and I have reflected that the nature of the offender himself is
akin to my own - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing
in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. Therefore I
cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with
their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him.
We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids,
like the rows of upper and lower teeth. So to work in opposition
to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection
is opposition.

Retreat from life to sound, and ready to depart, part the need

Be like the rocky headland on which the waves constantly break.
It stands firm, and round it the seething waters are laid to rest.

‘It is my bad luck that this has happened to me.’ No, you should
rather say: ‘It is my good luck that, although this has happened
to me, I can bear it without pain, neither crushed by the present
nor fearful of the future.’ Because such a thing could have
happened to any man, but not every man could have borne it
without pain. So why see more misfortune in the event than good
fortune in your ability to bear it? ...So in all future events
which might induce sadness remember to call on this principle:
‘this is no misfortune, but to bear it true to yourself is
good fortune.’

When someone is honestly 55 percent right, that’s very good
and there’s no use wrangling. And if someone is 60 percent
right, it’s wonderful, it’s great luck, and let him thank God. 

But what’s to be said about 75 percent right? Wise people 
say this is suspicious. Well, and what about 100 percent 
right? Whoever says he’s 100 percent right is a fanatic,
a thug, and the worst kind of rascal.

_Clarke's Three Laws_

1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something
is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that
something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
	- Arthur C. Clarke "Profiles of the Future" 1962

2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to
venture a little way past them into the impossible.

3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable 
from magic.
	~ Leigh Brackett 1942

4. For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,
but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact

Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again.
Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are
those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.

At some point, you are bound to stumble. If you’re constantly
pushing yourself higher and higher, the law of averages predicts
that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to
remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just
life trying to move us in another direction. Now, when you’re
down there in the hole, it looks like failure. When that moment
comes, it’s okay to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself
time to mourn what you think you may have lost. But then, here’s
the key: Learn from every mistake, because every experience,
particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you
into being more who you are.

I choose...
to live by choice, not by chance;
to make changes, not excuses;
to be useful, not used;
to excel, not compete.
I choose self-esteem, not self pity.
I choose to listen to my inner voice,
not the random opinion of others.

'Tis true my form is something odd,
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew
I would not fail in pleasing you.

If I could reach from pole to pole
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul;
the mind's the standard of the man.
