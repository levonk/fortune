There’s a saying that any idiot can build a bridge that can
carry a load, but only an engineer can build a bridge that
*barely* carries a load. This is a desirable trait; a bridge
that can carry any load would also carry an astronomical cost.

Designing to a price point that you’ve verified by market
research is engineering, and Juicero is the most spectacular
failure of this type of engineering in recent memory. Of 
course, it doesn’t help that Juicero has DRM’ed food, but
the success of K-cups tells me that’s probably not a
priority for a lot of consumers.

When someone is honestly 55 percent right, that’s very good
and there’s no use wrangling. And if someone is 60 percent
right, it’s wonderful, it’s great luck, and let him thank God. 

But what’s to be said about 75 percent right? Wise people 
say this is suspicious. Well, and what about 100 percent 
right? Whoever says he’s 100 percent right is a fanatic,
a thug, and the worst kind of rascal.

_Clarke's Three Laws_

1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something
is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that
something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
	- Arthur C. Clarke "Profiles of the Future" 1962

2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to
venture a little way past them into the impossible.

3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable 
from magic.
	~ Leigh Brackett 1942

4. For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,
but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact

Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again.
Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are
those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.

At some point, you are bound to stumble. If you’re constantly
pushing yourself higher and higher, the law of averages predicts
that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to
remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just
life trying to move us in another direction. Now, when you’re
down there in the hole, it looks like failure. When that moment
comes, it’s okay to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself
time to mourn what you think you may have lost. But then, here’s
the key: Learn from every mistake, because every experience,
particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you
into being more who you are.

I choose...
to live by choice, not by chance;
to make changes, not excuses;
to be useful, not used;
to excel, not compete.
I choose self-esteem, not self pity.
I choose to listen to my inner voice,
not the random opinion of others.

'Tis true my form is something odd,
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew
I would not fail in pleasing you.

If I could reach from pole to pole
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul;
the mind's the standard of the man.
