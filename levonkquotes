To bear up under loss — to fight the bitterness of defeat
and the weakness of grief — to be victor over anger — to
smile when tears are close — to resist evil men and base
instincts — to hate hate and to love love — to go on when
it would seem good to die — to seek ever after the glory
and the dream — to look up with unquenchable faith in
something evermore about to be — that is what any man
can do, and so be great.

Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of
wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly
endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that
all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition
as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of
yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.

A fellow of mediocre talent will remain a mediocrity, whether

One who fears the future, who fears failure, limits his activities.
Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again.

Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again.
Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are
those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.

At some point, you are bound to stumble. If you’re constantly
pushing yourself higher and higher, the law of averages predicts
that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to
remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just
life trying to move us in another direction. Now, when you’re
down there in the hole, it looks like failure. When that moment
comes, it’s okay to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself
time to mourn what you think you may have lost. But then, here’s
the key: Learn from every mistake, because every experience,
particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you
into being more who you are.

to make the same mistakes in the future.

I think it’s important to have a good hard failure when
you're young. I learned a lot out of that. Because it
makes you kind of aware of what can happen to you. Once
you’ve lived through the worst, you’re never quite as
vulnerable afterward.

You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in
the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.
