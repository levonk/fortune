A little bird was flying south for the Winter. It was so cold the bird froze
and fell to the ground into a large field.
While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to
realize how warm he was.

The dung was actually thawing him out!
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following
the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,
and promptly dug him out and ate him.

An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit saw
the eagle and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing?"
The eagle answered, "Sure , why not."

So the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested.
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the
top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."
"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.
"They're packed with nutrients."

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him
enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.

The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.

Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of
the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.

Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet

and I have reflected that the nature of the offender himself is
akin to my own - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing

cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with
their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him.

Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again.
Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are
those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.

At some point, you are bound to stumble. If you’re constantly
pushing yourself higher and higher, the law of averages predicts
that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to
remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just
life trying to move us in another direction. Now, when you’re
down there in the hole, it looks like failure. When that moment
comes, it’s okay to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself
time to mourn what you think you may have lost. But then, here’s
the key: Learn from every mistake, because every experience,
particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you

'Tis true my form is something odd,
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew
I would not fail in pleasing you.

If I could reach from pole to pole
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul;
